========================================================

If you wish t o try out the app, clic

Getting & Cleaning the Data
========================================================

The original data was sampled from three sources, (blogs, twitter and new) which is later merged into one

- Next, data cleaning is done, stipping white space, conversion to lowercase, removing punctuation and numbers. 
  Later after the process is completed, n-grams are created (Quadgram, Trigram and Bigram).
- Next, the count tables are extracted from N-Grams, and sorted with frequency in descending order.
- The final process is the n-grams are saved into R-compressed files, (.RData files).


Algorithm used 
========================================================

- Checks if highest-order (in this case, n=4) n-gram has been seen. If not "degrades" to a lower-order model 
  (n=3, 2); we would use even higher orders, the maximum ShinyApp size is 100mb.
